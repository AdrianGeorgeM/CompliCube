**Task:**
Build a single-page app using ReactJS that serves as a song search engine, interacting with the iTunes API. The app should have the following features:

1. Initial Page:
    - Display a centered search bar at the top of the screen.
    - Implement a search button that initiates the search once clicked.
2. Search Results Page:
    - Upon clicking the search button, navigate to a new page or component.
    - Display a list of cards containing song information (title, artist, and album).
    - Each card should also include an image of the album cover or track.
    - The list should be scrollable if there are more results than can fit on the screen.
    - Implement a back button to return to the initial search page.
